## About The Project
As an engineering student, I've always believed that developing a product to address a problem will not only help me understand how to utilize technology, but also tackle a common problem that society faces. Observing the widespread use of two-wheelers in my city just for short distances, I developed JazzBike, a marketplace model that allows individuals to monetize their idle bicycles by renting them to riders. I built the backend architecture in TypeScript using GraphQL and incorporated some interesting features like live tracking, in-app messaging, and a review mechanism for better cycling selections.
